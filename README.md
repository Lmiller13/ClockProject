# ClockProject
displays two clocks on 12hr and 24hr formats.
You can also manipulate the time that the clock outputs with you menu choices.
I think my functionality and output created a good working project.
One thing That should've done better on this project was to implement all of functions specified in the assignment.
Refrencing practice code in Zybooks and other materials helped me complete the task.
The code is made maintainable readable and adaptable by the use of standard naming conventions, good whitespace and well defined functions.
